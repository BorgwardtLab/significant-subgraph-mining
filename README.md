Significant Subgraph Mining with Multiple Testing Correction
============================================================

The first algorithm that efficiently finds all significant subgraphs from graph databases while correcting for multiple testing.

Summary
=======

Given a graph database (a collection of graphs) with class labels of graphs and significance level &alpha;, this algorithm efficiently computes:
* the corrected significance level that strictly controls the FWER under &alpha;, and
* enumerate all subgraphs that are statistically significantly associated with the class membership.

Please see the following paper for the detailed information about this algorithm and refer it in your published research:
